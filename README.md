# Hi there 👋 I'm Mohammad

🌱 I’m not a seasoned expert yet, but I’m deeply passionate about learning, experimenting, and growing every day.  
I enjoy exploring both **low-level programming** (Assembly, x86) and **high-level languages** (Python, Java, C), always curious about how things work under the hood.  

💻 **What I’m working on:**  
- Improving my skills in Python, Java, and C  
- Learning more about data tools like Pandas & NumPy  
- Exploring creative design with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro  

🚀 **My mindset:**  
- I believe progress comes step by step, through practice and curiosity.  
- I value clean, understandable code more than “perfect” code.  
- I’m open to feedback, collaboration, and new challenges.  

🔧 **Skills (still growing):**  
- 🐍 Python | ☕ Java | ⚙️ C | 🧩 Assembly | 🖥️ x86 | 🌐 HTML-CSS
- 🐼 Pandas | 🔢 NumPy | 🔧 Git  
- 🎨 Illustrator | 🖌️ Photoshop | 🎬 Premiere Pro  
- 📄 Word | 📊 Excel | 🗂️ Office Suite
